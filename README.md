## Hi there 👋
I'm Irene

I'm currently learning and building websites from scratch, focusing on clean layouts, structure, and problem-solving through code.

I enjoy the process of turning ideas into real, working projects and adjusting design, fixing bugs, refining details.

Right now I'm working with: HTML, CSS and starting Javascript.

Outside of coding, I'. interested in design, blender and buidling things that feel meaningful and personal.
